							<h1>Godot Project</h1>
							<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12dDe07gN37sOlx7v5o3jBY5KP77MnRMA/preview" width="560" height="315" allow="autoplay"></iframe></div>
							<p></p><p>My first major programming project was my Computer Science coursework unit, where I created a small game using the component-based game engine Godot. This game was my most ambitious project at the time, and I soon came to learn that I was perhaps too ambitious.</p>
							<p>What I did not consider when planning the scope of the project was that I would not only need to develop the game, but also meticulously document the entire process to satisfy the coursework requirements. This would significantly increase the overall time it would take to complete the project, and I ended up having to scale back and rush some elements of it in order to get it "finished" in time for the deadline.</p>
							<p>The final product can be seen in action in the above video. I will say that I do not think the game is very good from a gameplay perspective, particularly the combat system which is clunky and not fun to use. This is largely a result of time constraints, but also a learning experience for me on what makes good game design. From a technical perspective, however, I am very proud of what i achieved. I had never used Godot before, but I learned an awful lot about object-oriented programming, component-based architecture and general programming practices.</p>
							<p>The full source code for the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/danieljameskerry/godot-project-1"><i>my GitHub page</i></a>, and the full production process can be found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-XjfczI5NruqQWMvEDfrSJbQluR13AGTPUQ18DT_aC0/edit?usp=sharing"><i>Google Slides</i></a>, which I used for my coursework.</p>
							<p>I have since been working on another Godot project in my own time, which I started last summer and still haven't quite finished. I used the skills and knowledge that I learned from this project to move forward much more quickly and found myself referring to the documentation less and less. I hadn't used Godot at all before my coursework, and it was a huge learning experience that has now enabled me to confidently create more games using the engine.</p>
