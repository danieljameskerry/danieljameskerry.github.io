							<h1>Advertising Campaign</h1>
							<p><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fGmeUFmAFPoFxuD3KBFGDW1TbtOj_qTx/preview" width="800" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe></div></p>

							<p>Above is my production log for every component of a fictional advertising campaign that I created as part of Digital Media coursework in 2022. The campaign, which was for an also fictional BBC3 TV series that I had come up with as part of previous coursework, included a number of individual components: a TV trailer, a bus poster, and a number of social media posts. Copies of these components can be found on <a href="https://dkerrymedia.blogspot.com/2022/04/p4-campaign-components-production-log.html">my Blogger page.</a></p>
							<p>The most significant components is of course the <a href="https://youtu.be/hjv3lVTzQCw">minute-long TV trailer</a>, which was shot in my bedroom and involved multiple layers of video editing. The first layer was to create the video seen on the monitor in the trailer, which itself had to be timed correctly with the future voiceover and camera movements. Then I played that video on my monitor while filming it with my phone to produce the final footage which then needed to be edited again. The element I'm most proud of is the title card at the end of the trailer, where I used clipping masks and transitions to create a visually appealing reveal of the series' ident. As with my music video created the year prior, I edited footage using Adobe Premiere, and learned a good deal about the software in the process.</p>
							<p>The bus poster was created using Affinity Designer, and was comparitively simpler than the trailer to produce. I gathered real-world dimensions and researched existing bus posters to ensure I created a poster in the correct size and format, and as with all my coursework I created pre-production documents before moving onto the real thing.</p>
							<p>This advertising campaign unit, like all other units in Digital Media, was framed in a client brief as though I was a part of a professional team hired by the BBC. Of course it's not real, but allowed me to develop project management and professional skills that would be transferrable to real-world work where teams of people actually need to communicate with clients and meet their requirements for a project to be successful.</p>
